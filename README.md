A single-page resume for CS Graduate Students. It uses custom commands to provide consistent formatting and a clean, professional layout optimized for technical positions.

## Motivation

I have always (strongly) disliked editing resumes in Word documents because they're difficult to maintain, often break formatting unexpectedly, and don't provide consistent styling. LaTeX solves these problems with its structured approach to document creation, allowing for precise control over formatting and layout. This template was created to help fellow CS graduate students present their qualifications in the best possible light while removing the headache of resume formatting.
